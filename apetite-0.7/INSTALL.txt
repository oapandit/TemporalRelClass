Installation:
--------------

Use classical python module install

* locally:
 
> python setup.py build 

* globally (as root)

> python setup.py install

In the first case, you must add the path to 
the module to your python path, and the script to the path
i.e. in bash: 

export PYTHON_PATH=$PYTHON_PATH:installation_dir/build/lib/apetite
export PATH=$PATH:installation_dir/build/scripts-xxx/

Also, executables scripts are put locally in build/scripts

Prerequisites:
- python>=2.5
- igraph and bindings for visualization and graph analysis
